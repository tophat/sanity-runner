## Architecture

### Code Organization

The Sanity Runner codebase is organized as a monorepo with the help of [monodeploy](https://github.com/tophat/monodeploy).

The `service` directory contains the code which is ultimately packaged into the sanity-runner-service docker image, while the `client` directory contains the code which powers `yarn dlx sanity-runner-client` (and is also shipped as a docker image).

### Test Orchestration

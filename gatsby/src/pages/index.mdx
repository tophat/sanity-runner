The Sanity Runner is a test run orchestrator capable of running browser tests in a distributed serverless environment. It is not a testing framework in and of itself, but rather a tool that is used in conjunction with Puppeteer to run browser tests at scale, complete with alerting.

yarn dlx sanity-runner-service

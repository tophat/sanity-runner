## Contributing to Sanity Runner

### Getting Started

Optionally install nvm to ensure you're using the correct version of node. You can find the node version in the `.nvmrc` file. Once you have the right version of node selected, you'll want to enable [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) via `corepack enable`.

Install dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

This project uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Yarn Berry](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Build

You can execute `yarn build` to generate the build assets that ultimately gets uploaded to the NPM registry. It will also leave the intermediate `lib` artifacts, which contain the transpiled code.

### Running Local Tests

Followed by:

```sh
yarn build
```

Open 2 terminals, one for the service and one for the client.

In the service terminal execute:

```sh
SANITY_RUNNER_SLOW_MO=1000 yarn dev:service
```

One the service is up and running, execute:

```sh
yarn dev:client --test-dir example/repo/sanities/ --include google-fail-example -vv
```

To run the production image (no mounting), run:

```sh
yarn workspace sanity-runner-service run docker:prod
```
